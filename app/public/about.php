                    <p>If someone told me in high school that I’d be going to college for
                        computer science, I would’ve laughed at them. When I was little, I
                        always said I wanted to be a paleontologist, but as I got older I
                        realized that wasn’t a great career choice. In high school, I really
                        enjoyed the “tech” electives I took, especially metal-working-
                        related classes. In general, I liked making stuff. In my free time, I
                        would build armor and weapons from my favorite media out of
                        foam and cardboard, make YouTube videos, and draw. Ironically, I had
                        specifically hated the coding portion of these classes to the point where 
                        I avoided it wherever possible. With all of this in mind, 
                        I’m sure you’re thinking, “Why would you then choose to spend thousands of 
                        dollars and 4 years of your life doing something you hated”? The answer to 
                        that is that I was mistaken. I didn’t hate coding; I hated typing out repetitive 
                        commands to a virtual robot arm. I discovered this through a little game called Minecraft.<br><br> 
                        Minecraft is an open-world survival game that, while being plenty of fun on its own, has a 
                        sizable community of people who enjoy making “mods” for the game. These “mods” can be 
                        anything from simple modifications to adding in completely new stuff to the game. 
                        I had played Minecraft and used mods for years, even before high school, but eventually 
                        I became curious about how these mods were made. After looking into it, I realized I could make my 
                        own mods and add anything I wanted to the game. At this point, I had no idea what I was doing 
                        and was mostly just copy-pasting stuff to get the job done, but through playing around with 
                        modifying Minecraft, I became interested in coding, and realised it was a type of engineering that I enjoyed. 
                        All of this culminated in my choosing to go into computer science when applying to college.<br><br> After graduating 
                        from Clarence High School in 2021, I enrolled at the University at Buffalo, where I would graduate with a 
                        bachelor's in computer science in 2025. Being such a large school, UB gave me the opportunity to meet and 
                        interact with a very wide variety of people. This, along with a majority of the courses having team-focused 
                        projects, allowed me to work with countless different types of not just comp sci majors, but computer 
                        engineers and other engineering majors due to some overlap in certain courses. The way that my curriculum 
                        was set up also allowed me to dip my toes into all sorts of different areas of computer science; from 
                        low-level architecture to web development, distributed systems, robotics, machine learning, and more. 
                        I truly feel like I got a rounded experience that allowed me to try out almost everything I had even a 
                        slight interest in.
